You probably know that computers don't communicate with each other the way that people do.
Instead, computers require codes, or directions. These binary codes and commands allow computers to process needed information.
Every second, billions upon billions of ones and zeros are processed in order to provide you with the information you need.
</p>
<br>
<p>
So what does that have to do with your ability to post your latest pictures online? Everything.

<br>

The methods by which computers communicate with each other through the use of markup languages and multimedia packages is known as web technology.
 In the past few decades, web technology has undergone a dramatic transition, from a few marked up web pages to the ability to do very specific work on a network without interruption.
  Let's look at some examples of web technology.</p>

      <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
         With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.<br>
          HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
          HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.<br>
           Other tags such as <p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.<br>
             Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>

      <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.<br>
         This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .
         <br>css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .
         <br>css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>

      <p>JavaScript  often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
        <br>JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.
        <br>It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
        <br>It is a zero-index programming language.</p>
